First of all, stop calling me a leaf it's annoying, racist and makes zero sense
Second, Canada leads the world in happiness, healthcare, diversity and generally just a great place to live
Third, Trudeau isn't perfect but he's WAY better than that asshole you got in Washington
Fourth, our national identity and pride hasn't dissapered, it's still here we just wanted to share it with others
Fifth, Canada doesn't have school shootings everyday like America or radical censorship like England, so we're better than both of you
Sixth, Canada is a fantastic sports country, it's not just muh football which has died recently
Seventh, our politics are more fair and even
Eighth, our lumber industry, nuff said
Ninth, we have a vast array of land diversity
Finally, people WISH they were Canadian, people want to be us badly

So yeah, fuck off haters and fuck you racists and homophobes.
